# Sparkify

## Overview

One of the most important metrics for subscription based services is member churn.  Understanding why members choose to leave your service and taking steps to prevent that exodus, can be the difference between a successful and a failing business model.  Using the fictional company “Sparkify”, we will explore the concept of churn and attempt to build a functional model for identifying users at risk for it.
